<p align="justify">
Voting Management System is an online voting system where a voter can use his/her voting 
right online without any difficulty. A unique user id is given to the voter, by using that id he/she 
can cast his/her vote. If conditions are wrong then that entry will be discarded. The voting 
management system is an essential tool that ensures the smooth running of elections. This 
system requires efficient file structuring to manage the vast amounts of data generated during 
the electoral process. The file structure consists of different files, such as the voter file, 
candidate file, ballot file, and election result file. These files store all the necessary information, 
such as voter details, candidate details, and voting results, in an organized manner. The voting 
management system's file structure also includes different access methods, such as sequential 
access and direct access, to retrieve information efficiently. The system's file structure is 
designed to ensure data integrity, security, and privacy. Effective file structuring is critical to 
the success of any voting management system, as it facilitates the retrieval of accurate and 
timely information during and after the electoral process.

system plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and transparency of the democratic process. 
It involves collecting and verifying information about individuals who intend to run for various 
positions, such as local, regional, or national offices. <br>

to remove a registered voter's information from the system's database. This feature is typically 
designed to be used in situations where a voter's registration needs to be invalidated or removed 
permanently for various reasons. <br>
